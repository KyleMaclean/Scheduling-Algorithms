# scheduling-algorithms
Implementing popular scheduling algorithms to solve synchronisation problems. Concepts: critical sections, binary/counting semaphores, mutexes, parallel programming, bounded/unbounded buffers. Algorithms: First Come First Served (with pre-emption), Round Robin (with temporary priority boosting).
